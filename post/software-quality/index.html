<p>Software does not run in a magic fairy aether powered by the fevered dreams of CS PhDs.</p>

<p>&ndash; <cite>Mike Acton</cite></p>
</blockquote>

<p>Recently I&rsquo;ve come to adopt a new definition for what I consider quality
software. It&rsquo;s really three primary things:</p>

<ol>
<li>It solves the problem you set out to solve, and ideally, <em>ONLY</em> that problem.</li>
<li>It does so, while <em>efficiently</em> using the hardware underneath you.</li>
<li>It is written in a reasonable amount of time</li>
</ol>

<p>1 forces you to intimately understand your problem. This is the key to not only
coming up with a good solution, but also not creating more problems which you
don&rsquo;t actually need to solve. Mike Acton would say that you also need to
understand the cost of solving your problem, in addition to the problem itself -
otherwise you don&rsquo;t actually understand the problem in the first place.</p>

<p>2 is less about saving money, or increasing revenue (from faster response
times), than it is about simply not being wasteful of our planet&rsquo;s resources
(software doesn&rsquo;t run on fresh air), or your user&rsquo;s time. Over the last three
decades computers have become an order of magnitude faster, but can we say
that software today feels an order of magnitude more responsive?</p>

<p>3 is important for more reasons that simply needing to release on time. You
have a finite amount of hours in your life, and a finite amount of projects that
you can complete in your lifetime. Not to mention that you&rsquo;d probably also want
to have a life outside of code.</p>

<p>These goals are complementary in many ways. Caring about hours of your life
spent coding, means that you ruthlessly have to cut out any anything that doesn&rsquo;t
actually solve your problem. This more than likely leads to better software
performance and efficiency from less code bloat alone.</p>
